# cookery
my first small game made using pyglet. pour as much beer as you can and avoid overfilling the mugs.

this is inspired by a game I loved as a kid, Ore No Ryomi 2. And its sequel Cook Serve Delicious which I recently discovered. I made this clone of the basic beer-serving mechanic in that game because I thought it would be an easy way to learn how to use pyglet.

works with Python 2.7 and pyglet 1.2.4 on Ubuntu... probably works elsewhere but I haven't checked.
