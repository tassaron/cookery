# cookery
my first small game made using pyglet. pour as much beer as you can and avoid overfilling the mugs.

this is inspired by a game I loved as a kid, Ore No Ryomi 2. And its sequel Cook Serve Delicious which I recently discovered. I made this clone of the basic beer-serving mechanic in that game because I thought it would be an easy way to learn how to use pyglet.

now updated to work in Python 3 and Pyglet 1.5.9

originally made for Python 2.7 and Pyglet 1.2.4

works on Ubuntu and Windows
